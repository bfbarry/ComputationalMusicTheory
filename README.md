# Computational Music Theory

Investigating mathematical properties of harmony, and maybe make a music recommendor algorithm out of it

IDEAS:
- implement chroma vector
- Wave properties of certain chords: can we understand why chord progressions sound nice?
- chord graph
- Given a random chord, what is its hamming distance from a nice, normal chord?
    - Like how many steps do you have to take to get to a nice chord?
    - How does this differ depending on the number of notes? (2 notes will always be "nice")  What about the range on the keyboard?
    - Extent to what 'nice' sounds like
        -some jazz chords sound harsh
    - find probability distribution of this number
- Chords often fuse into each other (circle of fifths), how to account for that?
- It would be cool to visualize harmony with color
